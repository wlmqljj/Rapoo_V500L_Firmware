# Rapoo_V500L_Firmware
## Rapoo v500l (manufactured before 2019) have issue below
### 1.Long pressing the tab key will jump to escape occasionly.
### 2.Debounce delay the stock holtek firmware ship with is set too short by Rapoo when the switches get aging.

The update program contains in the 7z archive named `V500L吃鸡失灵升级固件（含操作方法）.7z`  
The binary Windows exe files will flash the holtek mcu that fix the jumping escape when long press the tab key, 
and also a fix for debounce delay too short.

This update came form the uploading from warm-hearting friend posted to the tieba.baidu.com.
A huge thanks to this friend!  
___Use this with caution!!!___  
___Only for V500L manufactured before 2019!!!___  
DO NOT remove any cable and DO NOT turn off your pc when flashing!!!  
The process will automatically finished when you connect the keyboard.  
It will show "PASS" when finished, then you can plug off the USB cable after that.

贴吧老哥在2019年分享的雷柏v500L键盘固件更新，可以修复v500L在吃鸡时长按TAB键会跳esc的固件问题，同时键轴需要更长的debounce时间，这个固件完美修复了问题，在此分享。
